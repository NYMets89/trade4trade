# Trade4Trade
Trade4Trade is a digital marketplace that brings users from around the world together to exchange services and skills, without the need for money. Payment is done with an old-school, barter style approach, but modernized. A basic functionality of the app is that a teacher/giver of a service is also a learner/receiver of a service. This app operates on the premise that everyone, regardless of education, skill, race, gender, religion and/or criminal history has something to offer.
